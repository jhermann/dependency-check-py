Overview
--------

``dependency-check`` scans application dependencies and checks whether they contain any published vulnerabilities
(based on the NIST `NVD`_).
It runs in the JVM, so you need some form of ``java`` available in your ``PATH``.
The script should work on Linux, Mac OSX and Windows, but right now is only tested on Linux.


Usage
-----

After installation, you'll have the ``dependency-check`` command available that, on first use,
will automatically download and install the OWASP release archive once for all projects.
It'll then redirect any calls to that installation, meaning the downloaded NVD data is shared
amongst projects.

.. code-block::

    dependency-check --disableAssembly -s . -o build --project "$(python ./setup.py --name)" \
        --exclude ".git/**" --exclude ".venv/**" --exclude "**/__pycache__/**" --exclude ".tox/**" \
        && xdg-open build/dependency-check-report.html

Please see the `DependencyCheck site`_ for more configuration and usage details.

To install from PyPI, add ``dependency-check`` to your ``dev-requirements.txt``
or a similar file. For more installation options, see the “Installation” section below.

Customization
-------------

Using environment variables, you can change the version and download location of the release archive,
and the directory for the local installation.

=============================== ==============================================================================================
Variable                        Default
=============================== ==============================================================================================
``DEPENDENCY_CHECK_VERSION``    ``6.2.2``
``DEPENDENCY_CHECK_URL``        ``https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/releases/download/v{version}/dependency-check-{version}-release.zip``
``DEPENDENCY_CHECK_HOME``       ``~/.local/dependency-check``
``DEPENDENCY_CHECK_NVD_URL``    *Use NIST NVD URLs*
=============================== ==============================================================================================

To update to a new version of the OWASP software,
delete ``~/.local/dependency-check/bin/``,
set ``DEPENDENCY_CHECK_VERSION`` to the new version number,
and call ``dependency-check``.

The variable ``DEPENDENCY_CHECK_NVD_URL`` can be used to point to a local copy of the various NVD feeds,
in a flat hierarchy with compressed JSON files.

.. code-block:: shell

    export DEPENDENCY_CHECK_NVD_URL='https://repo.local/nvd/nvdcve-1.1-%d.json.gz'

If you set this, the options ``--cveUrlBase`` and ``--cveUrlModified`` will be added to each call.
Note that the ``%d`` representing the year is replaced by ``modified`` for the latter.

Remove the ``~/.local/dependency-check/data/`` directory to force a full data reload.


Installation
------------

To just get the ``dependency-check`` CLI tool installed into your home,
independent of any project, call ``python3 -m pip install --user dependency-check`` as usual,
see `releases`_ for an overview of available versions.

If you prefer an **isolated and easily removable venv installation**,
consider using `dephell jail install dependency-check`_ instead.

To get a bleeding-edge version from source, use these commands::

    repo="jhermann/dependency-check-py"
    python3 -m pip install -r "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/$repo/master/requirements.txt"
    python3 -m pip install "https://github.com/$repo/archive/master.zip#egg=dependency-check"

As a developer, to create a working directory for this project, call these commands::

    git clone "https://github.com/jhermann/dependency-check-py.git"
    cd "dependency-check-py"
    command . .env --yes --develop
    invoke build --docs test check

You might also need to follow some
`setup procedures <https://py-generic-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html#quick-setup>`_
to make the necessary basic commands available on *Linux*, *Mac OS X*, and *Windows*.
